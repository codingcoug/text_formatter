# text_formatter

This is intented to be a text formatter for the Central Access Reader.
* it processes text to remove single newline caracters so that CAR can read the text with minimal stopping.

Thoughts for improvements
* add add a double newline character about every 10-20 lines. This is so that modifying reading speed in CAR can be achieved
** otherwise the program will never have an opportunity to process the change in settings
